The search results provide some insights:\n\n1.  **Ubuy India**: It seems Ubuy India sells the Framework Laptop 13 DIY Kit (13th Gen i7 1360p, 32GB RAM, 1TB) for approximately INR 145,765. They mention it's not available locally but offer express shipping. This indicates that Framework itself might not have a direct presence or official retail channel in India yet.\n2.  **Kirti Enterprise (Tradeindia)**: Lists \"framework laptop\" at INR 34,000.00 in Kalyan, Maharashtra. However, the price is suspiciously low for a Framework laptop, and the description also mentions other unrelated products like \"Alienware Laptops\" and \"Gaming Mouse\". This might be a generic listing for \"framework laptops\" (laptops used within a framework/structure) rather than the brand \"Framework Laptop\". The company also deals in a wide range of electronics and refers to \"Framework\" as a trader/retailer of Ink Tank Printers, Dell CPU, etc., which suggests they are not an official Framework Laptop distributor.\n3.  **Etsy India**: Lists various \"framework laptop\" related items, but these appear to be accessories or components, not the full laptop itself.\n4.  **Laptop6.in and Justdial**: These sites list prices and specifications for \"Framework Laptop 13 12th Gen\" in India and mention \"Framework Laptop Suppliers\". Laptop6 states the price as INR 89,438, but also warns that prices and specifications might not be 100% correct and advises checking local markets. Justdial lists \"Framework laptop\" and \"Framework Laptop Suppliers\" with average ratings but doesn't explicitly confirm official retail channels or direct sales of the brand \"Framework Laptop\". They also list various other unrelated electronics sellers.\n\nBased on the results, it appears that **Framework Laptops do not have an official direct sales presence or authorized retailers in India currently.** The most concrete option found is through **Ubuy India**, which imports the Framework Laptop 13 DIY Kit. The other listings on Tradeindia and Justdial seem to be either generic product categories or possibly resellers without official ties to the Framework brand, especially given the inconsistent pricing and product descriptions.\n\nTherefore, the primary and most reliable way to obtain a Framework Laptop in India, based on these search results, is through an international e-commerce platform like Ubuy.\n\nI can now formulate the answer.Currently, Framework Laptops do not have an official direct sales channel or authorized retailers in India. However, you can purchase a Framework Laptop 13 DIY Kit (13th Gen i7 1360p, 32GB RAM, 1TB) through Ubuy India. Ubuy offers this product for approximately INR 145,765 and provides express shipping to India, noting that the product is not available locally.\n\nOther listings found on platforms like Tradeindia and Justdial appear to be either generic references to \"framework laptops\" (not the specific brand) or resellers of various electronics without clear official ties to the Framework brand, with some prices being significantly inconsistent. Websites like Laptop6.in also list Framework laptop prices in India but advise checking local markets due to potential inaccuracies.\n\nTherefore, Ubuy India seems to be the most viable option for acquiring a Framework laptop in India.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"user_query\": \"where to buy framework laptop in india\",\n  \"answer\": \"Currently, Framework Laptops do not have an official direct sales channel or authorized retailers in India.

Some results also offer details on refresh rates, display technologies (QLED, OLED, LED), and smart TV features (Google TV, Android TV, Tizen). I also found a YouTube video listing \"top 55 inch Smart TVs with QLED, OLED, and 4K display technology with the latest features\" and their deal prices, including some effective prices after discounts. This is very relevant.\n\nHowever, a direct \"best deals\" list with specific current discounts and their expiration dates is not explicitly available in a structured format from the search results. The prices mentioned are mostly current listed prices or \"deal prices\" from a YouTube video that seems to be from an \"Amazon Great Indian Festival 2025\" event (which, given the current date of Jan 2026, would be from last year's festival, so prices might have changed).\n\nI need to synthesize the information to provide a list of products with their prices, and if possible, highlight any good deals or noteworthy features. I will primarily focus on the products with mentioned \"deal prices\" or those presented as good value options. I will also include key specifications.\n\nGiven the information from the search results, I can extract product names, descriptions (key features like display type, resolution, smart TV OS, refresh rate, audio output), and prices. I will look for any mentions of pros and cons, but these are less common in the provided snippets.\n\nI will focus on the models explicitly mentioned with prices and some descriptive details, especially those highlighted as \"deals\" or good value.Here are some of the best deals on 55-inch 4K TVs in India, featuring various brands and technologies, with prices and key specifications:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"user_query\": \"best deals on 55 inch 4k tv\",\n  \"answer\": \"Finding the 'best deals' can be subjective and vary based on current promotions.
