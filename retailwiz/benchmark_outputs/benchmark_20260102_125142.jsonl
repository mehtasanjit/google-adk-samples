It offers over 20 levels of customization for noise cancelling, including an option to turn it off entirely.\n*   **Sound Quality:** Many reviews highlight the rich and detailed sound, with a more audiophile sound profile than previous models, offering balanced, accurate sound, better clarity, and tighter bass. However, some suggest that EQ adjustments via the Sony app are \"desperately needed\" or recommended to unlock their full potential and achieve a \"very fun\" listening experience. Without EQ, the stock sound may be a \"knock\" against them.\n*   **Comfort:** The headphones are generally noted for being comfortable and lighter than their predecessors (WH-1000XM4). However, some users, particularly those with smaller heads, have reported discomfort due to pressure from the headband during prolonged use. The ear cup padding is described as mushy, which some found less comfortable than the previous generation.\n*   **Battery Life:** The WH-1000XM5 offers roughly 27 to 30 hours of continuous playback with ANC, making them suitable for long travel or daily use.\n*   **Microphone Performance:** The microphone delivers clear voice capture, effectively separating voice from background noise. However, loud sustained noises can occasionally cause the voice to cut out, and performance may be worse when tested on a phone.\n*   **Design and Build:** The headphones feature a new design with a matte finish that resists fingerprints and are available in black and silver. While the plastic build of the headband appears high-tech and durable, some reviews express concern about the \"questionable build quality,\" especially around the plastic hinges, given the price point. The carrying case is larger than previous models because the headphones only fold flat.\n\n**Comparisons and Value:**\n\n*   The Sony WH-1000XM5 is often compared to the Bose QuietComfort Ultra, Sennheiser Momentum 4, and AirPods Max, with some reviewers placing it alongside the Bose QuietComfort Ultra for comfort and ANC performance.\n*   While they remain a top choice for their features and performance, increased competition and a similar feature set to earlier models make them a slightly tougher sell than before, despite general price cuts.\n*   They are generally considered a strong overall package due to their impressive feature set, excellent sound (especially with EQ), and improved voice calling, often preferred over Bose Noise Canceling 700 and QuietComfort 45."}

The S24 Ultra, released in January 2024, is known for its powerful Snapdragon processor, versatile camera system with extensive zoom capabilities, and the integrated S Pen stylus. The Pixel 9 Pro series, launched in late 2024, emphasizes AI-driven software, exceptional computational photography, and a pure Android experience, available in both a compact 6.3-inch model and a larger 6.8-inch \"XL\" variant.\n\nHere's a comparison of their key aspects:\n\n**Performance:** The Samsung S24 Ultra generally offers superior raw processing power with its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chipset, making it a stronger choice for heavy gaming and demanding tasks. The Pixel 9 Pro's Tensor G4, while optimized for AI and daily use, may show limitations in intense gaming scenarios.\n\n**Display:** Both phones feature large, vibrant AMOLED displays with 120Hz refresh rates. The S24 Ultra boasts a QHD+ resolution (3120 x 1440 pixels) and an impressive 2600 nits peak brightness, along with anti-reflective technology. The Pixel 9 Pro XL also has a 6.8-inch display, while the standard Pixel 9 Pro offers a more compact 6.3-inch screen. The Pixel displays, termed \"Super Actua,\" also offer high brightness and resolution.\n\n**Cameras:** Both devices excel in photography, though with different approaches. The S24 Ultra features a 200MP main sensor and a versatile quad-camera setup with 3x and 5x optical zoom, and up to 100x digital zoom (though the latter is often considered a gimmick). The Pixel 9 Pro series features a 50MP main camera, a 48MP ultrawide, and a 48MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. The Pixel often stands out for its computational photography, producing images with excellent contrast, shadows, and less oversharpening compared to Samsung, along with unique AI camera features like \"Add Me\" and automatic photo unblur.\n\n**Battery Life & Charging:** Both phones generally offer all-day battery life with moderate use. The S24 Ultra comes with a 5000mAh battery and supports 45W fast charging, though some reviews note it's not exceptionally fast. The Pixel 9 Pro has a 4700mAh battery, while the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a 5060mAh battery, with charging speeds of 27W.\n\n**Software & AI:** The S24 Ultra runs Android 14 with Samsung's One UI 6.1 and includes extensive \"Galaxy AI\" features, with a promise of 7 years of OS and security updates. However, some AI features might become paywalled after 2025. The Pixel 9 Pro runs a near-stock Android 14 experience with Google's exclusive AI features, also promising 7 years of OS updates.\n\n**Unique Features:** The S24 Ultra includes an integrated S Pen stylus, offering unique productivity and creative capabilities. The Pixel 9 Pro is praised for its more compact form factor option (6.3-inch) while retaining the full Pro camera system.\n\n---\n```json\n{\n  \"user_query\": \"samsung s24 ultra vs pixel 9 pro comparison\",\n  \"answer\": \"The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and Google Pixel 9 Pro (including the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL) are both leading Android flagships, each offering a distinct set of features and strengths.
